# Implementation process pipeline

This template repo helps with setting up a pipeline for an OSLO implementation process (implementatietraject).

- [Application profile](https://data.vlaanderen.be/doc/applicatieprofiel/leermiddelen/ontwerpstandaard/2025-03-21/)
- [SHACL](https://data.vlaanderen.be/doc/applicatieprofiel/leermiddelen/ontwerpstandaard/2025-03-21/shacl/leermiddelen-ap-SHACL.ttl)

## Usage

### Setting up this repository

You only have to do these steps once.

1. [Create a new repository based on this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. Set the link to the application profile at `env.ap_url` in the file `.github/workflows/demo.yml`.
3. Set the link to the SHACL at `env.shacl_url` in the file `.github/workflows/demo.yml`.
4. Read and, if necessary, update [the license](LICENSE).
5. [Set up GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
   and let it point to the `docs` directory on the `main` branch.
6. Run the pipeline to make sure that everything works.
   This run will use the dummy data in the [data](./data) directory.
7. If everything works, empty the [data](./data) directory.
8. [Configure the dashboard](#configure-the-dashboard).

### Configure the dashboard

You can configure the dashboard via the following steps:

1. Create a copy of [this directory](https://github.com/RMLio/ap-data-to-dashboard/blob/main/miravi-initial-config/)
   in the root of the repo called `dashboard-config`.
2. Update the content of `dashboard-config`.
   You find the options of the dasboard in `dashboard-config/config.json`.
   See [this section](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/miravi-a-linked-data-viewer?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-file)
   for more information about the different options.
   You don't need to add the option `comunicaContext`,
   because the pipeline sets this automatically.
   You store queries in `dashboard-config/public/queries`.

3. Fill in your data in the Excel file.
4. Upload the Excel to the repository.
